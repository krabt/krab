# Changelog

All notable changes to Krab are documented here. Versions correspond to
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/krabt/krab/releases).

## 🚀 v0.19.0 — Wails v3
-- **wails v3**: update to wails v3.
-- **outbound rule**: support outbound rule.

## 🧩 v0.18.0 — More transports

- **New transports**: mKCP (with header type and seed), HTTPUpgrade, XHTTP (mode and
  advanced JSON options) and h2. xray-core no longer ships the plain HTTP/2 transport, so
  h2 servers are connected over XHTTP's HTTP/2 stream mode.
- gRPC gains multi mode and authority.
- **ECH** (Encrypted Client Hello) for TLS and Hysteria2 servers — hides the real site name
  from network filters. Set it in the editor or via the `ech` link parameter.
- Share links and Clash, sing-box and Xray subscriptions using these transports import
  correctly, and all of them can be set in the server editor.

## 🐛 v0.17.1 — Tidier "Add manually" row

- The protocol buttons under "Add manually" wrap onto a new line instead of being cut
  off at the edge of the sidebar.
- A new SSH server starts on port 22.

## 🔐 v0.17.0 — SSH servers

- **SSH** — use any SSH server as a proxy, like `ssh -D`: password or private key (with
  optional passphrase), and optional host-key verification (`SHA256:…` fingerprint or
  public key). Works in proxy and TUN mode; DNS is resolved over TCP through the tunnel.
- `ssh://user:password@host:port#name` links import and share; SSH servers can be added
  manually and edited.
- SSH carries TCP only — apps that try UDP (e.g. QUIC) fall back to TCP automatically.

## 🚀 v0.16.0 — Hysteria2 support

- **Hysteria2** — `hysteria2://` and `hy2://` links now import and connect, including
  Salamander obfuscation, port hopping (`443,20000-30000`), custom SNI and certificate
  pinning (for self-signed servers). Hysteria2 servers also load from Clash, sing-box and Xray JSON
  subscriptions.
- The server editor supports Hysteria2, and it can be added manually.
- Pinging a Hysteria2 server always measures real delay, since it runs over UDP (QUIC).

## ⚡ v0.15.1 — More accurate TCP and HTTP ping

- **TCP / HTTP ping** no longer count the DNS lookup of the server's hostname — the
  address is resolved first and only the connection itself is timed, so values reflect the
  real network path (lists where many servers share one hostname were most affected).
- TCP ping takes the best of two handshakes, so one slow packet doesn't skew the result.

## ✨ v0.15.0 — Edit servers and add them manually

- **Server editor** — the pencil on a server now opens a full editor instead of just a
  rename box: name, address, port; UUID / password / method depending on the protocol,
  VLESS flow and encryption, VMess cipher; transport (TCP with optional HTTP header,
  WebSocket, gRPC) with host, path and service name; security (none, TLS, REALITY) with
  SNI, fingerprint, ALPN, public key, short ID and spiderX.
- **Add manually** — the add panel can create a new VLESS, VMess, Trojan or Shadowsocks
  server from scratch in the same editor.

## 🐛 v0.14.1 — Accurate real delay and connection test

**Real delay** and **Test connection** reported several hundred ms too much: they timed the
very first request through the server, which is mostly one-off setup (TCP plus the TLS /
REALITY handshakes to the server and then to the test site). Both now send a warm-up
request first and report the second one over the already-open connection, so the number
reflects the actual round trip, comparable with other V2Ray clients.

## ✨ v0.14.0 — Ping: sort by delay, remove failed servers, test one subscription

- **Sort by delay** — fastest servers first, failed ones last (in the **⋮** menu next to Ping).
- **Remove failed servers** — deletes every server that failed the last test, after asking.
- **Test one subscription** — ping just that group instead of everything.
- **Stop** — cancel a test that's running.
- **Results are remembered** — delays stay visible after restarting, until the next test.
- **Clear results** from the same menu.

## ✨ v0.13.0 — Ping servers: TCP, HTTP or real delay

Under the search box there's now a **TCP · HTTP · Real delay** switch and a **Ping** button;
every server shows its delay (green under 300 ms, amber above, red when it fails).

- **TCP** — time to open a connection to the server's port. Fastest, but only proves it's
  reachable.
- **HTTP** — time until the server answers a plain HTTP request on its port.
- **Real delay** — starts a temporary xray-core connection through the server and loads a
  test page (`generate_204`). The only mode that proves the server really works (right keys,
  transport, encryption).

The measurement code lives in the shared `pkg/probe` package, so the Android app measures
exactly the same way.

## 🐛 v0.12.2 — Support VLESS post-quantum encryption

Servers using xray-core's new VLESS encryption (`encryption=mlkem768x25519plus...` in the
link) rejected every connection, because Krab always sent `encryption: none`. The link's
`encryption` value is now passed through. The link parser and config builder also moved to
public `pkg/profile` and `pkg/xrayconf` packages, shared with the new
[Android app](https://github.com/krabt/krab-android).

## 🐛 v0.12.1 — Fix clipped subscription share menu

The subscription Share menu was cut off by its card (only the first option was visible).
It now opens above everything else.

## ✨ v0.12.0 — More subscription formats, share and edit

- **More subscription formats**: besides the base64 link list, Krab now imports Clash/Mihomo
  YAML (`proxies:`), sing-box JSON and Xray JSON (`outbounds`), and Shadowsocks SIP008
  JSON. Unsupported entries (e.g. hysteria2) are skipped instead of failing the import.
- **Share**: every server has a share button that copies its standard link. Subscriptions
  can copy their URL, or all their servers as a plain link list.
- **Edit subscriptions**: rename a subscription or change its URL.
- **Auto-sync**: subscriptions re-sync on launch when the interval the provider asks for
  (`Profile-Update-Interval`) has passed.
- Subscriptions named via the `Profile-Title` header (3x-ui, Marzban) use that name.
- Unlimited plans (`total=0`) now show how much you've used instead of nothing.
- Server names are trimmed (some panels add a leading space).

## 🐛 v0.11.1 — Fix TUN reconnect and traffic looping after disconnect

xray-core doesn't always release its Wintun adapter when a TUN session closes. The leftover
adapter kept its routes, so after disconnecting, all traffic — including xray's own
connection to the server — kept flowing into a dead tunnel, and reconnecting failed with
"initialization has already been completed".

- Disconnect now deletes Krab's TUN routes *before* closing xray, so a lingering adapter
  can't capture traffic.
- Each TUN connection uses a fresh adapter name and address (`krab-tun-N`,
  `172.19.N.1`), so it never collides with a leftover one. The kill switch allows the
  whole `172.19.0.0/16` range to match.
- On launch, Krab removes TUN routes left behind by a previous run.

## 🔀 v0.11.0 — xray-core only, with its own TUN mode

sing-box is removed; Krab runs on xray-core alone again, and the engine picker is gone.
TUN mode now uses xray-core's own TUN, so **every server works in TUN mode** — including
`tcp` + `headerType=http` links that sing-box could never connect.

- xray-core only creates the Wintun adapter, so Krab now configures it itself: a static
  address (172.19.0.1/30), DNS 1.1.1.1 (sent through the tunnel, lowest interface metric
  so Windows prefers it), and two `/1` routes that take over from the default route.
- The server's hostname is resolved once before connecting and xray dials that IP (keeping
  the hostname for SNI and the `Host` header), with an exception route so the connection
  to the server itself stays outside the tunnel. Otherwise xray's own DNS lookup would
  go into the tunnel it's trying to build.
- The retry for "adapter still releasing" on quick reconnects carries over.
- Traffic stats work in both proxy and TUN mode.
- The binary is noticeably smaller without sing-box.

## 🐛 v0.10.4 — Fix TUN mode never connecting (DNS loop)

In TUN mode sing-box couldn't resolve the server's own hostname: its DNS lookups were
routed back into the TUN adapter it was feeding and timed out, so every connection failed
with `lookup ...: context deadline exceeded`. The TUN config now sets
`route.auto_detect_interface` (sing-box binds its own sockets to the real network
interface), resolves the server hostname with the system resolver, and hijacks apps' DNS
queries to answer them over the tunnel (1.1.1.1 via the proxy) so they aren't poisoned or
leaked locally.

## 🐛 v0.10.3 — Reliability pass: kill switch, proxy, subscriptions, parser, UI

**Networking**
- **Kill switch actually works now.** Windows Firewall evaluates block rules before allow
  rules, so the old "block all outbound" rule also blocked Krab itself. It now switches the
  default outbound policy to block and allows only Krab, the TUN adapter, and system DNS.
- **No more lost internet after a crash.** On launch, Krab turns off a system proxy it left
  pointing at itself and removes leftover kill-switch rules.
- **Your own proxy is no longer switched off** when Krab quits or disconnects — it only
  clears the proxy if it's Krab's.
- System proxy now bypasses LAN addresses (router pages, NAS, printers), not just `<local>`.
- **Linux/macOS:** SOCKS proxy was set to the HTTP port — now uses the SOCKS port. macOS
  also sets the HTTPS proxy and applies to every network service, not just "Wi-Fi".
- **xray-core + WebSocket + TLS:** forces ALPN `http/1.1` (an `h2` ALPN broke every dial).
- No more console windows flashing up when Krab runs `netsh`/`route`.

**Subscriptions & links**
- **Syncing a subscription no longer wipes it if the fetch fails** (offline, provider down).
- Imports write the server list once instead of once per server (much faster for big lists).
- `vmess://` links with numeric `port`/`aid` now parse; `alpn`, `fp`, `type`, `scy` are kept.
- Legacy `ss://BASE64#name` links now parse.

**Updater**
- No 2-minute cap on the download (slow connections failed every time); a truncated
  download is now rejected instead of installed; the leftover `.old` exe is cleaned up.

**UI**
- Status refreshes on its own — disconnecting from the tray no longer leaves the window
  showing "Connected".
- Syncing a subscription keeps your selected server selected.
- Choosing TUN switches the engine to sing-box automatically (xray-core has no TUN).

## 📊 v0.10.2 — Wire up real traffic stats for xray-core

Live/total traffic in the "Show more" panel has read a stubbed 0B/s ever since the
v0.9.0 sing-box migration, on both engines. Fixed for the default engine: `config.go`
now turns on `policy.system.statsOutboundUplink`/`Downlink` and an empty `stats: {}`
block, which makes xray-core register per-outbound byte counters
(`outbound>>>proxy>>>traffic>>>uplink`/`downlink`) in its own `stats.Manager`;
`manager.go` fetches that feature right after `Start()` and `Traffic()` now reads the
real counters instead of returning a stub.

sing-box's equivalent (`trafficcontrol.Manager`, exposed via `experimental.clash_api`)
still isn't wired up -- unlike xray-core's stats manager, it isn't reachable through
`box.Box`'s small set of exported getters, so registering it needs pushing a traffic
manager into the same internal `context.Context` the box builds its services from
before calling `box.New`. Left as a stub for now (see README known gaps); switching to
sing-box (for TUN mode) still means 0B/s in that panel.

## 🌐 v0.10.1 — Russian translation

- Added Русский (Russian) as an 8th UI language, alongside English, 中文, فارسی,
  Türkçe, العربية, Français, and Deutsch.
- README's language list and count updated to match.

## 🔀 v0.10.0 — Bring back xray-core as a selectable engine (now the default)

The v0.9.0 sing-box migration traded away xray-core's `tcp&headerType=http` transport
with no replacement -- servers using it simply can't be reached
under sing-box at all. Rather than pick one engine's limitations over the other's,
Krab now embeds both and lets you switch from the About panel: **xray-core is the new
default** (broader transport support), **sing-box is the only one with TUN mode**
(xray-core has no TUN inbound here). The choice is global and persisted
(`settings.json` next to `servers.json`), and can only be changed while disconnected.

`internal/xray` is now a thin facade that dispatches every call to whichever concrete
engine is selected -- `internal/engine/xraycore` (moved/rewritten from what v0.9.0
deleted) or `internal/engine/singbox` (the code that used to live directly in
`internal/xray`). `app.go` needed no changes beyond three new bound methods
(`GetEngine`/`SetEngine`/`EngineName`) since the facade's public API is unchanged.

## 🐛 v0.9.4 — Fix TUN mode failing with "gVisor is not included in this build"

TUN mode couldn't start at all after the sing-box migration: `internal/xray/config.go`
hardcoded the TUN inbound's `stack` to `gvisor`, but that network stack needs the
`with_gvisor` Go build tag (an extra netstack dependency `release.yml`'s build step
doesn't pass), so sing-box refused to start with "gVisor is not included in this
build, rebuild with -tags with_gvisor". Switched to the `system` stack, which uses
the OS's own TUN handling and needs no extra build tag.

## 🐛 v0.9.3 — Force http/1.1 ALPN for WebSocket transport

WS links whose `alpn` param included `h2` (a common default from subscription
generators, alongside `http/1.1`/`h3`) still failed after v0.9.2's SNI fix: the TLS
handshake completed, but the connection was closed right after by the server -- a
TLS-terminating edge that prefers h2 (Cloudflare, notably) negotiated it from the
offered ALPN list, turning the connection into an HTTP/2 stream that sing-box's plain
HTTP/1.1 WebSocket-upgrade client can't work over. `internal/xray/config.go` now
forces `alpn: ["http/1.1"]` whenever the transport is `ws`, ignoring whatever ALPN
list the link specified for that case.

## 🐛 v0.9.2 — Default TLS SNI to the server address

Plain `security=tls` links with no `sni` param (and `host` present but empty, as some
subscription generators emit) connected past the handshake but were closed by the server
around ~400ms in, because `internal/xray/config.go` left sing-box's outbound `tls.server_name`
unset in that case -- sing-box sends no SNI extension at all unless `server_name` is set,
which most TLS-terminating servers/CDNs reject since they can't route the connection. Under
xray-core this same link worked because it silently defaulted SNI to the server's own
address; sing-box now does the same.

## 🐛 v0.9.1 — Fix REALITY connections after the sing-box migration

VLESS+REALITY servers failed to connect after v0.9.0 with a `connection download closed:
unknown version: 72` / `EOF` error in the log. Cause: REALITY only works because the
client's TLS handshake mimics a real browser (uTLS) instead of Go's own `crypto/tls` --
when a share link's `fp` (fingerprint) parameter was empty, `internal/xray/config.go`
wasn't enabling uTLS at all, so the reality server couldn't recognize the connection as
legitimate and fell back to serving its camouflage site in plaintext (the "unknown
version" error is Go's TLS parser choking on that plaintext HTTP response). Now defaults
`fp` to `chrome` whenever REALITY is enabled and the link didn't specify one.

## 🔀 v0.9.0 — Switch engine from xray-core to sing-box

Krab's embedded proxy engine is now [sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box)
instead of xray-core. `internal/xray` keeps its historical name/package path (renaming it
wasn't worth the churn across the rest of the codebase) but its `manager.go`/`config.go`
are rewritten from scratch against sing-box's Go API: a `box.Box` instance built from
`option.Options` decoded via sing-box's own registry-aware JSON decoder
(`include.Context` + `json.UnmarshalContext`), instead of xray-core's `core.Instance` +
`conf.Config`.

- vmess, vless, trojan, and shadowsocks over tcp/ws/grpc, with TLS/REALITY/uTLS, all
  carried over.
- TUN mode carried over (sing-box's own `tun` package), including the retry-on-
  adapter-still-releasing logic and the antivirus/wintun.dll error hint from v0.8.5-8.
- **Regression**: sing-box has no equivalent of xray-core's `type=tcp&headerType=http`
  disguise -- a link relying on that specific obfuscation won't connect anymore. See
  README known gaps.
- **Regression**: live traffic stats (the "Show more" panel) are a stub again, always
  reading 0B/s -- xray-core's stats manager doesn't have a sing-box equivalent without
  enabling its clash-api, which isn't wired up yet. See README known gaps.
- `App.XrayVersion()` (About panel) now reads the resolved `sing-box` module version from
  the Go build info instead of xray-core's `core.Version()`.

## 🐛 v0.8.8 — Retry TUN reconnect instead of guessing a fixed wait

- v0.8.7's fixed 800ms pause after a TUN disconnect wasn't reliably
  long enough -- reconnecting could still hit the previous session's
  Wintun adapter not finished releasing yet, with the same "already
  been completed" error. Replaced the guess with a real retry: a
  TUN-mode `Start()` now retries up to 5 times with increasing backoff
  specifically on that error, rebuilding a fresh `core.Instance` each
  attempt, instead of hoping one fixed delay was enough. If it's still
  failing after every retry, the error now says plainly that the
  previous session hadn't finished releasing its adapter in time.

## 🐛 v0.8.7 — Fix reconnecting in TUN mode right after disconnecting

- **Fixed a real bug**: xray-core's TUN inbound doesn't finish tearing
  down the Wintun adapter/session synchronously within `Close()` --
  reconnecting in TUN mode immediately after disconnecting could hit
  the adapter/session still being released and fail with "An attempt
  was made to perform an initialization operation when initialization
  has already been completed." `Manager.Stop()` now pauses briefly
  after a TUN-mode disconnect to give it time to actually finish first.

## 🐛 v0.8.6 — Fix relaunch still not reopening when connected

- **Fixed a real bug**: v0.8.4's fixed 1.5s wait for the old process to
  quit before the new one registers itself wasn't always enough --
  `RestartElevated` didn't disconnect (stop xray/TUN, clear the proxy,
  remove kill switch firewall rules) before relaunching, leaving all of
  that for `OnShutdown` to do *after* `Quit()`, eating into the new
  process's wait window. If you were connected (TUN and/or kill switch
  especially) when restarting elevated or updating, that cleanup could
  easily take longer than 1.5s, so the new process still saw the old
  one as "alive" and gave up -- same "nothing reopens" failure as
  before, just needing a slower shutdown to trigger it.
  `RestartElevated` now disconnects proactively before relaunching
  (`ApplyUpdate` already stopped xray/cleared the proxy, but was
  missing the kill switch cleanup -- added), and the wait window is
  bumped to 3s for extra margin.

## ✨ v0.8.5 — Clearer error when antivirus deletes wintun.dll

- TUN mode failing with a raw, unhelpful OS error like "The system
  cannot find the file specified" almost always means antivirus
  software (Windows Defender included) quarantined `wintun.dll` right
  after Krab wrote it next to itself -- a kernel-adjacent networking
  DLL like this commonly gets flagged heuristically, the same issue
  WireGuard/v2rayN and other Wintun-based apps run into. Krab now
  detects this specific case and wraps the error with a clear
  explanation and the fix (add Krab's folder to antivirus exclusions)
  instead of leaving the user to guess at a generic Windows error.

## 🐛 v0.8.4 — Fix Restart as admin not reopening Krab at all

- **Fixed a real bug**: v0.8.3 fixed the *old* process exiting the wrong
  way, but the race was still there from the other side -- spawning the
  new (elevated, or updated) process is near-instant, while the old one
  quitting isn't *quite* as instant. The new process's own
  `SingleInstanceLock` registration could still run first, see the
  (about to die) old process as "already running", and defer to it
  instead of actually starting -- then the old process finished quitting
  anyway, leaving nothing running at all: click "Restart as admin", UAC
  prompt, accept, and no Krab window ever comes back.
  `RelaunchElevated`/`update.Apply` now pass a `--krab-relaunch-wait`
  flag; the new process waits 1.5s before registering itself, giving
  the old one time to actually finish quitting first.

## 🐛 v0.8.3 — Fix duplicate windows from Restart as admin / self-update

Two real bugs, both around the same root cause:

- Since closing the window keeps Krab running in the tray (v0.8.0)
  instead of quitting, launching the exe again (e.g. double-clicking
  it, or a "Restart as admin"/self-update relaunch) risked a second
  process colliding with the still-running first one over native
  resources -- WinTun, the system proxy registry keys -- producing
  native errors like "An attempt was made to perform an initialization
  operation when initialization has already been completed" and two
  overlapping windows. Added Wails' `SingleInstanceLock`: a second
  launch now just asks the already-running instance to show itself.
- That exposed a second bug: "Restart as admin" and the self-update
  relaunch both exited the old process via a raw `os.Exit(0)`, which
  bypasses Wails' own shutdown path -- including whatever releases the
  `SingleInstanceLock`'s IPC listener. The freshly-launched new process
  (elevated, or updated) could still see the dying old one as "already
  running" and get treated as a second instance instead of actually
  starting, leaving two windows open with neither one elevated or
  updated. Both now quit via `wailsruntime.Quit`, matching how the
  tray's own Quit already worked correctly.

## 🐛 v0.8.1 — Fix tray right-click menu

- The system tray added in v0.8.0 didn't show its menu on
  right-click -- `energye/systray` doesn't do that automatically, it
  has to be wired up explicitly via `SetOnRClick` calling
  `menu.ShowMenu()`.

## 🔒 v0.8.0 — Kill switch, system tray, right-click paste fix

- **Fixed right-click paste**: Wails disables the browser's native
  right-click context menu in production builds by default, so
  right-click did nothing anywhere in the app -- including pasting a
  link into the Add Server field. Re-enabled via
  `options.App.EnableDefaultContextMenu: true`.
- **Persian text now always uses Vazirmatn**, not just when Persian is
  the active app language -- e.g. "فارسی" as a label inside the
  language picker while some other language is selected now renders
  correctly too (`[lang='fa']` alongside the existing `[data-lang='fa']`).
- **Kill switch (Windows)**: a new toggle next to Proxy/TUN blocks all
  outbound traffic except Krab's own while connected, via a
  `netsh advfirewall` rule pair (allow Krab's own process, block
  everything else) -- loopback is exempt from Windows Firewall
  filtering regardless, so the local HTTP/SOCKS proxy keeps working.
  Needs administrator privileges, same as TUN mode. The block rules are
  only removed on a deliberate Disconnect (or app quit) -- not if xray
  crashes while connected, which is the point of a kill switch.
- **System tray**: closing the window now hides it to the tray instead
  of quitting, so an active connection (and kill switch, if on) keeps
  running. The tray icon's menu has Show Krab, Disconnect (shown only
  while connected), and Quit Krab; left-clicking the icon also restores
  the window. Only "Quit Krab" actually exits the app.

## 📊 v0.7.1 — Real traffic stats

- **Traffic stats are wired up for real** — `internal/xray/stats.go`'s
  `Traffic()` used to always return zero. `buildJSON` now turns on
  `policy.system.statsOutboundUplink`/`Downlink` so xray-core registers
  the "proxy" outbound's traffic counters, and `Manager` reads them
  from its own `stats.Manager` feature.
- The connect panel gets a collapsible "Show more" panel (closed by
  default) with **Live traffic** (current up/down speed, polled once a
  second while connected) and **Total traffic** (cumulative session
  bytes).

## ℹ️ v0.7.0 — Show the embedded xray-core version

- The About panel now shows the embedded xray-core version next to
  Krab's own version (e.g. "v0.7.0 · xray-core 26.3.27"), via
  `core.Version()` from xray-core itself.

## 🍎 v0.6.9 — macOS builds are back

- Re-enabled macOS in the release matrix, on `macos-14` (Apple Silicon)
  instead of the old `macos-13` (Intel), which had very long GitHub
  runner queue times. Ships as `krab-macos-arm64` — the raw binary
  pulled out of the `.app` bundle Wails produces, unsigned and
  unnotarized, so the first run needs
  `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine krab-macos-arm64` or right-click →
  Open to get past Gatekeeper.
- Self-update now recognizes `darwin` and looks for the
  `krab-macos-arm64` release asset (previously only Windows/Linux were
  wired up, so self-update silently had nothing to offer on macOS).

## 🐛 v0.6.8 — Fix tcp+HTTP-header-obfuscation connections

- **Fixed a real bug**: a link with `type=tcp&headerType=http` (TCP
  transport disguised behind a plaintext HTTP request, so an
  HTTP-sniffing front end in front of the real server doesn't reject
  the connection) was being sent as plain, undisguised TCP -- Krab
  never built a `tcpSettings.header` block at all. The front end saw
  what looked like garbage and answered with a plain HTTP response
  instead of proxying through, producing the same
  `unexpected response version... actually 72` error as the REALITY
  bug fixed in v0.6.7, but for a different reason. `streamSettings` now
  builds the HTTP disguise header (method/path/Host/User-Agent) for
  `network=tcp` links that specify `headerType=http`.

## 🐛 v0.6.7 — Fix REALITY connections

- **Fixed a real bug**: a `security=reality` link was being sent to
  xray-core as plain `security: "tls"`. Since REALITY isn't TLS -- it
  proxies unauthenticated clients straight through to the real
  (camouflaged) destination it's impersonating -- the client ended up
  doing an ordinary TLS handshake against that real site and got back
  a plain HTTP response instead of VLESS, failing every connection
  with `unexpected response version... actually 72` (`H` from
  `HTTP/1.1`). `streamSettings` now builds a proper `realitySettings`
  block (publicKey/shortId/spiderX/fingerprint/serverName) for
  `security=reality` links instead of collapsing it into `tls`.

## 📊 v0.6.6 — Usage progress bar for subscriptions

- The subscription group card now shows a usage strip below the
  header: a filled progress bar for traffic used vs. total, and the
  plan's expiry date, instead of squeezed text on one line.

## 🔄 v0.6.5 — Subscription usage info and a sync button

- The subscription group row now shows plan info when the provider
  reports it: traffic used/total and days left, parsed from the
  `Subscription-Userinfo` response header when present, falling back to
  the human-readable "info" line(s) some providers mix into the link
  list itself (previously discarded outright).
- Added a **sync button** on the subscription group (next to remove) to
  re-fetch that subscription and refresh its server list in place.

## 🐛 v0.6.4 — Subscription groups, info-node filtering, and a real ID bug fix

- **Fixed a real bug**: `profile.Store.Add` assigned a server its ID on
  an internal copy and never returned it, so both `AddProfileFromLink`
  and the new `AddSubscription` handed the frontend a server with an
  empty ID. Selecting and connecting to a server added in the current
  session (before any list refresh) failed with `no server with id ""`.
  `Store.Add` now returns the stored copy, ID included.
- **Subscription grouping**: servers imported from one subscription URL
  are folded into a single collapsible row (closed by default) instead
  of flooding the list — a subscription can carry hundreds of servers.
- **Info-node filtering**: some subscription providers mix in fake
  vless://-style entries whose host is a placeholder like
  `dontUseThis` and whose name carries plan/expiry/traffic text, just
  so it shows up as a row in clients that list every node. Those are
  now recognized and skipped instead of being imported as dead servers.

## ✨ v0.6.3 — Subscription URL support

- The "Add server" field now also accepts a subscription URL
  (`http://`/`https://`), not just a single share link. Krab fetches it,
  decodes the standard base64 link-list format used by V2RayN/V2RayNG/
  Shadowrocket-compatible providers, and imports every server it can
  parse in one go. Entries that fail to parse are skipped rather than
  failing the whole import.

## 🎨 v0.6.2 — Vazirmatn font for Persian

- Persian (فارسی) now renders with the bundled Vazirmatn font instead of
  the system default.

## 🌐 v0.6.1 — Keep LTR layout for Persian and Arabic

- Persian and Arabic keep full text translation, but the UI layout no
  longer flips to right-to-left.

## 🌐 v0.6.0 — Multi-language UI

- Added a language picker (sidebar, next to About): English (default),
  中文, فارسی, Türkçe, العربية, Français, Deutsch.

## 📝 v0.5.3 — About panel rework, MIT license

- **About panel**: fuller description, a copyable repo link, and quick
  Repository / Releases / Report-an-issue shortcuts, instead of a single
  bare GitHub link.
- Added an **MIT license** (`LICENSE`) and linked it from the README.
- Set the GitHub repo's description and topics (`v2ray`, `xray`, `vpn`,
  `vmess`, `vless`, `trojan`, `shadowsocks`, `wails`, `tun`, …) so the
  project actually surfaces in GitHub search.

## 🐛 v0.5.2 — Fix country flag not rendering on Windows

- Windows' emoji font (Segoe UI Emoji) doesn't support regional-indicator
  flag emoji — it fell back to printing the raw two-letter code (e.g.
  "FI FI") instead of a flag. The Test result now renders a real flag
  image instead of relying on emoji support.

## ✨ v0.5.1 — Test result shows exit IP, country, and real delay

- The Test button's result used to just say "OK (HTTP 204)" against
  Cloudflare's `generate_204` endpoint — no proof of *which* server you
  were actually exiting through. It now hits Cloudflare's trace endpoint
  and shows the VPN server's real exit IP, its country, and the actual
  round-trip delay of the request made through the tunnel.

## ✨ v0.5.0 — TUN mode (Windows), update download progress

- **TUN mode**: a Proxy/TUN toggle now appears on Windows. TUN mode routes
  *all* system traffic through a virtual network adapter instead of just
  apps that honor a proxy setting, using xray-core's own built-in `proxy/tun`
  inbound with the bundled Wintun driver. Since creating a system-level
  network adapter needs administrator rights, Krab checks elevation and
  offers a one-click "Restart as admin" when it isn't already elevated.
  An exception route is added for the VPN server's own resolved IP(s)
  *before* xray's TUN inbound brings up its default route, so xray's own
  outbound connection doesn't loop back through the adapter it's feeding.
  Windows-only and IPv4-only for this first pass — see README known gaps.
- **Update progress**: the self-update banner now shows a live percentage
  and progress bar while downloading, instead of a static "Updating…".

## 📝 v0.4.1 — Branding and docs

- Added the Krab app logo/icon throughout the app and README.
- Rewrote the README (features, architecture, downloads, known gaps) and
  started this CHANGELOG.

## ✨ v0.4.0 — About panel, self-update, dark/light theme

- **Self-update**: Krab now checks GitHub Releases on launch. When a newer
  build is available, a banner offers a one-click update — it downloads the
  new executable, swaps it in for the running one, and relaunches
  automatically. No installer or admin rights needed, since Krab is a
  portable single-file executable.
- **About panel**: version, a link to the GitHub repo, and a manual
  "Check for updates" button (info icon in the sidebar rail).
- **Dark / light theme toggle**: the whole UI now runs on CSS custom
  properties instead of hardcoded colors, with a sun/moon toggle in the
  rail that persists your choice.

## 🎨 v0.3.0 — UI redesign

- Replaced the original single-column list-and-button layout with a
  three-pane app shell: a slim icon rail, a searchable server list with
  inline rename/remove on hover, and a connect panel centered on a large
  power-dial button.

## ✨ v0.2.7 — The real connect fix

- Root-caused and fixed the actual reason connections were failing:
  xray-core's WebSocket transport shares its TLS config with Go's
  `net/http`, so a link's `alpn=http/1.1,h2,h3` (forwarded as-is) made Go
  negotiate HTTP/2 instead of performing the WebSocket upgrade, and every
  dial failed with `websocket: protocol "h2" was given but is not
  supported`. ALPN is now skipped for `ws`/`websocket` transport.

## ✨ v0.2.6 — Real connectivity diagnostics

- Added a **Test** button that makes an actual HTTP request through the
  local proxy and reports the real result (or the exact Go error) instead
  of a "running" status that says nothing about whether traffic is
  actually flowing.
- xray-core's own debug log is now written to disk and viewable inline via
  a **Show log** toggle — this is what ultimately located the ALPN bug
  above.

## ✨ v0.2.5 — TLS/transport detection fix

- `vless://`, `trojan://`, and `ss://` links use `security=`/`type=` query
  parameters, but the config builder was only checking the vmess-style
  `tls`/`network` key names. TLS was silently never enabled for those
  three link types, so every connection attempt went out in plaintext to a
  TLS-only port and hung. Both key spellings are checked now.

## ✨ v0.2.4 — Windows system proxy fix

- `netsh winhttp set proxy` requires an elevated process and only affects
  WinHTTP-based services anyway (not the browsers people actually use).
  Replaced it with writing the per-user `HKCU\...\Internet Settings`
  registry keys directly — no elevation needed, and it's what browsers and
  most Windows apps actually read.

## ✨ v0.2.3 — Self-healing profile storage

- A saved server profile with an empty ID (from very early testing, before
  ID assignment was solid) made Connect/Rename fail with
  `no server with id ""`. The profile store now backfills a fresh UUID for
  any entry missing one and persists the fix automatically on load.

## ✨ v0.2.2 — VLESS/VMess outbound config fix

- `go.mod` pins xray-core v1.8.24, whose `VLessOutboundConfig` only
  understands the classic nested `vnext` array — not the flat
  `address`/`port`/`id` shorthand added in later xray-core versions.
  Outbound configs are now built with the classic nested `vnext`/`servers`
  shape, which every xray-core version understands.
- Added **Remove** and **Rename** for saved server profiles.

## 🐛 v0.2.1 — Error surfacing

- `Connect`/`Disconnect` failures were previously swallowed silently by
  the frontend — a real backend error looked exactly like "nothing
  happens." Errors now render in a banner, and the app shows its own
  version (baked in via `-ldflags` at build time) in a footer.

## ✨ v0.2.0 — Real xray-core integration

- `internal/xray/manager.go` now actually starts and stops a real
  xray-core `core.Instance`, instead of just flipping an internal status
  flag.
- `internal/xray/config.go` builds the standard Xray JSON config shape and
  runs it through xray-core's own `conf.Config.Build()` — the same path
  xray-core itself uses to load a config file.
- `app.go`'s `Connect`/`Disconnect` now call into `internal/system` to
  actually toggle the OS proxy.

## 🎉 v0.1.0 — Initial scaffold

- Project structure: Wails entrypoint (`main.go`/`app.go`), `internal/xray`
  (lifecycle stubs), `internal/profile` (link parsing for `vmess://`,
  `vless://`, `trojan://`, `ss://`, plus JSON file storage), `internal/system`
  (per-OS proxy toggle stubs), and a React + Tailwind frontend.
- GitHub Actions release workflow that builds Windows and Linux binaries
  and publishes them to GitHub Releases on any pushed `v*` tag (macOS was
  dropped from the matrix after the `macos-13` runner pool showed very
  long queue times).
